  <h1><span>Loss of Vision: How Early 20th century Photography Was Misjudged by Critics and How Archives Obscure the Image</span></h1>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WW&nbsp;&nbsp;WW</b> hile both historical archives and museums collect photography, they approach it in different ways. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Whereas museums collect a few pieces, a historical archive which has photographs in the millions may take the <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
photographer’s entire body of work. I have been working with large collections of photography for 35 years now <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
in my job as the Visual Materials Curator/archivist. Such collections which may range from 10,000 to 100,000 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
images allow you to see their work in a way that viewing just a few pieces of a photographer’s work can never match.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Having worked with many collections of early commercial photography, I become particularly interested in the <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
misinterpretations of commercial photography by modern critics and art historians who judge it using incorrect <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
standards, and I also became interested in how the photographic document can be obscured by both photographers <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
themselves and by archival practice. First I am going to discuss how photography critics, can misjudge the work <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
of commercial photographers due to their lack of understanding the social milieu and the working methodology <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
of the commercial photographer. A great example of this is in Max Kozloff’s 2007 book Theater of the Face: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Portrait Photography Since 1900. Kozloff is a historian and art critic and has written numerous books and articles <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
on art and photography.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Theater of the Face, Kozloff discusses a photograph by E.J. Bellocq, a turn of the century New Orleans <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  photographer. Bellocq worked as a professional photographer recording landmarks, ships, and machinery for <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  various clients in the New Orleans area. Little is known about him; after his death his work was destroyed. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Eighty-nine negatives of prostitutes in the Storyville area of New Orleans made in about 1912 were found and later <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  in 1966 were purchased by the art photographer, Lee Friedlander. Friedlander printed the 8x10 negatives on gold <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  toned printing out paper (to emulate how he thought Bellocq might have printed) and a show of the work was hung <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1970. Several books of the photographs have been published based <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  on the prints made by Lee Friedlander. There are no Bellocq prints of the Storyville prostitutes but recently, some <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  examples of his regular work came to light. They are typical commercial work of the time.
