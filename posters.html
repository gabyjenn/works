      <i>Things That Happen Near Water</i> is a poster series of the following three movies: <i>Everything Else</i> dir. by Natailia Almada, <i>Shoplifters</i> dir. by Koreeda Hirokazu, <i>The Last Black Man in San Francisco</i> dir. by Joe Talbot. Strangely enough, these movies have in common that there are certain events connected to water. The characters' mirage-like dreams and wishes fade in to the pool, river, and ocean.<br>
